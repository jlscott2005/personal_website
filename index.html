      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone. I am currently working on becoming a web developer. I will be traveling to Chicago, IL to finish my learning with DevBootcamp. I have been learning for about 6 months and will finish the DevBootcamp process in April.</p>

      <h2>Something I Love</h2>
      <p>This one is easy. I love my family. I have a beautiful wife and two dogs. My wife and I have been married for 3 and a half years. We have had our dogs for 2 years(Nugget) and about 6 months(Remy). I love spending time with my wife and pups when I'm not learning to code.</p>

    	<h2>Quirks</h2>
    	<p> We are being encouraged to offer something quirky about ourselves. I am a musician. I have played many instruments in my younger days and now love to play the djemba. It is an African drum that has one head. You have to get creative to make it produce different sounds. That is why I love it.</p>
